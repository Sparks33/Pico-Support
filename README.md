# Pico's Terms of Service Â©

When utilizing the bot, you hereby agree to utilize all commands in a responsible and ethical manner, refraining from any misuse or abuse of said commands. In the event that you encounter any bugs or glitches, we kindly request that you promptly inform our staff, rather than exploiting them. Be advised that any misconduct or attempts to compromise the integrity of our support servers will result in corresponding consequences, which may include server or bot bans.

The aforementioned consequences will similarly extend to our forthcoming websites. Anyone found engaging in hacking activities or attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in our websites will face a permanent ban from all our bots and servers.

Please be aware that we hold no responsibility for any infractions committed on other servers employing our bot, nor do we bear responsibility for the rules enforced within those servers.

Violation of rules within our support server (as delineated in [ðŸ“œï½œrules](https://discord.com/channels/1147589677830918154/1147590147404218439)) will lead to server-related consequences and potential limitations on bot access.

In using the bot, you agree to have your user id stored in our database so we can indentify you when using commands. We do not store any message content or profile information.

# Privacy Policy

Our data storage practices are designed to prioritize user privacy and minimize the information retained. We exclusively store essential data such as a user's ID, guild ID, and other bot-related metrics like levels, coin counts, and message counts. It is crucial to note that we do not store sensitive information such as user avatars, banners, usernames, statuses, descriptions, or message contents. Our data collection is limited to the bare minimum required for user identification within our database, and to distinguish commands across servers. Importantly, this data is exclusively employed for the bot's internal operations and is never shared with external parties.

Should you wish to have your data removed, we offer the option to request data deletion. Our developers are committed to promptly fulfilling such requests. In the absence of deletion requests, data is retained for the duration of the database's existence. This ensures that users do not need to re-register, leading to an enhanced and more seamless bot experience. Your privacy and convenience are our utmost priorities in managing this data.

We never share any data to others. If you have concerns about your data then you may request it is deleted by contacting our developers. You can find us by joining our support server. The only data that may be shared is bot data such as a users warnings, level etc and this is only shared to other users using the same commands.
